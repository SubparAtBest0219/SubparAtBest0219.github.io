                  Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals and values, and prepare me to enter the computer science field in numerous ways. The work I’ve done showcases how hard I’ve worked to understand the material given to us. I’ve worked with different languages as my first enhancement was ported to an entirely different language. I was able to showcase my ability to leverage different libraries and packages through my work on all three enhancements while integrating their functionality into my programs. I’ve also demonstrated my ability to work with and understand algorithms through my work on enhancement three via insertion sort proving that even the most complex subjects and methodologies can be broken down given enough time. The biggest strength that I was able to showcase is my ability to design, develop, and understand databases and successfully integrate them within pre-existing code to enhance it without the use of Gradle, Maven, etc., showcasing my ability to think outside of the constraints of what may or may not be possible in terms of development. I took the work we did as first-year students to the extreme as well leveraging Python libraries to develop a music bot utilizing YouTube API and even taught myself a bit about cloud platforms as I deployed it remotely so that others could enjoy it. None of this would have been possible without the foundation that Southern New Hampshire instilled in me.

                  The work on my ePortolio, this course, and the entire program has pushed me to be the best I can be in terms of development. There’s an entire server full of students struggling and pushing through these assignments just like I was. Utilizing this server, I’ve demonstrated my ability to collaborate in a team environment as we are all there for the same reason. We want to be the best we can be whether that means helping others with their understanding of the code or asking for help ourselves. Regardless, this has proved to be one of the most extensive and helpful resources out there. Communicating with stakeholders is a topic that can be a bit subjective. We are given requirements, and as we progress through the program are given less and less to work with in terms of what we can interpret from what is being asked. This is rectified through instructor feedback and communication. When requirements are subjective and vague, we reach out and ask questions regarding the individual requirements. This is exactly what would be expected of us in terms of communicating with stakeholders. They want the job done right, and it is our job and responsibility to ensure we deliver a satisfactory application. Data structures and algorithms are topics many students struggle with, however, there are a tremendous number of resources available to help break down the ideology behind a certain algorithm. When looking at the code it seems a bit redundant and hard to understand what exactly is happening even though the functionality of the code is rather simplistic. This would not be possible without the knowledge gained throughout my work in this course and the program as most of these algorithms were covered through course materials in a way that they were easy to learn and adapt to fit our needs. Software engineering and databases were the highlights of this program. I was able to adapt a program from one language to another leveraging terminal commands for functionality and fully integrating a database into existing code while refactoring to enhance modularity. I’ve been exposed to singleton patterns, different designs, and different libraries all culminating in the vast number of resources I have to draw on. One of the subjects students tend to struggle the most with is security as the majority of assignments are only focused on completion rather than best practices. This program changed this mindset as it will always be expected of us to adhere to best practices in terms of security including but not limited to ensuring proper usage of scanner resources, leveraging memory allocation, and in my case input validation. This course took my skills and gave me a chance to shine, and I hope that through my work on this ePortolio, I’ve accurately captured just how much I’ve learned and how prepared I am to enter the highly competitive field of computer science.

                  My ePortfolio showcases a very diverse range of artifacts that demonstrate my proficiency in numerous areas. My first enhancement can briefly be summarized as a simple clock program fitted with a user interface capable of accepting user input to manipulate what is being shown. This may not seem like much, but the original project with written in CPP and I’ve since ported this to Java demonstrating my ability to understand what was written and refactor it. I then implemented try/catch statements to address security concerns surrounding input validation when utilizing the scanner resource. I also created a separate file containing terminal commands to adapt functionality given Java does not have any innate clear screen method demonstrating my proficiency with design.  My second and third enhancements are both based on one program. I wrote a program in Java surrounding an animal rescue program designed to intake animals, reserve animals, and show what animals are currently in the system titled Grazioso Animal Rescue. Through my work on enhancement two, I utilized algorithms to sort animals to clean up the lists being returned. Through my work on enhancement three, I connected a MongoDB to the existing Java code transforming this makeshift database program into a fully functional database program. I then adapted my algorithms to sort records, I incorporated input validation on my intake methods, and I leveraged try/catch statements in conjunction with scanner resources for management. I’ve worked hard to ensure that each of these projects meets the expectations of the course in terms of outcome. I’ve thoroughly vetted the work done, and am satisfied with the results, I hope you all will be too. Without further ado, I’d like to introduce you all to my technical artifacts, my clock application, and my Grazioso Animal Rescue Database!
